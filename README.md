Create an Android application that retrieves, parses and displays a list of tweets related to Justin Bieber (with #bieber hashtag). Each tweet should include information such as: the tweet content, the creation time, the user who tweeted and their profile picture. Load the tweets in a background thread so you don't block the UI thread.
